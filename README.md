Improve Reddit ads targeting by doing a little research via the Reddit API

1. Use ChatGPT to generate a long list of keywords related to the topic your users/community are interested in.
2. If you don't already have access, register to use the API and create your credentials  (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api/).
3. Run search.py to pull up a list of subreddits about your topic.
4. Run search_content.py to pull up a list of subreddits with top posts _about_ your topic.
5. Run filter.py to filter those subreddits based on recency / activity thresholds.
6. Target the final list of subreddits in your Reddit Ads campaign.
